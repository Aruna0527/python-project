# Employee’s Performance for HR Analytics



*   **Employee performance for HR analytics is the data-driven evaluation of how individuals and teams meet job goals, measured through KPIs (like sales, project completion), engagement, productivity metrics (absenteeism, revenue/employee), and satisfaction, to identify trends, improve management, and align HR strategies with business outcomes, moving beyond intuition to make informed, strategic decisions about talent and workforce effectiveness.**

# Domain
  **HR ANALYTICS**
  # Objective

1. To identify meaningful patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA)

2. To clean, transform, and preprocess the data for analysis

3. To create meaningful visualizations that clearly explain the story behind the data

4. To provide actionable insights and recommendations from the analysis

# Data Pre-processing
*  **The analysis journey began with data preprocessing, where I meticulously cleaned the 'Uncleaned_employees_final_dataset'. Duplicate rows were eliminated, and irrelevant data types in numeric columns were filtered out using Python.**
