# Employee’s Performance for HR Analytics



*   **Employee performance for HR analytics is the data-driven evaluation of how individuals and teams meet job goals, measured through KPIs (like sales, project completion), engagement, productivity metrics (absenteeism, revenue/employee), and satisfaction, to identify trends, improve management, and align HR strategies with business outcomes, moving beyond intuition to make informed, strategic decisions about talent and workforce effectiveness.**

# Domain
  **HR ANALYTICS**
  # Objective

1. To identify meaningful patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA)

2. To clean, transform, and preprocess the data for analysis

3. To create meaningful visualizations that clearly explain the story behind the data

4. To provide actionable insights and recommendations from the analysis

# Data Pre-processing
*  **The analysis journey began with data preprocessing, where I meticulously cleaned the 'Uncleaned_employees_final_dataset'. Duplicate rows were eliminated, and irrelevant data types in numeric columns were filtered out using Python.**
# Note For Kind of Analysis to be done
**Type of Analysis**

**Descriptive Analysis (summarizing the dataset)**

 Analyzes historical data to understand what has happened in
  the workforce over a specific period.
  
**Diagnostic Analysis (finding reasons behind patterns)**

Identifies the causes of success of failure within a workforce,
which can be used to correct failures and boost business performance.

**Predictive Analysis (optional if forecasting required using basic stats)**

Uses a combination of historical data to predict the likelihood
of future outcomes based on past data so that businesses can
make accurate forecasts.

**Prescriptive Analysis (recommendations for business decisions)**

Relies on historical data. It is typically used after
predictive analysis to plan the most suitable course of
 action for the organization to meet its goals.
