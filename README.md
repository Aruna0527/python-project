# Employee’s Performance for HR Analytics



*   **Employee performance for HR analytics is the data-driven evaluation of how individuals and teams meet job goals, measured through KPIs (like sales, project completion), engagement, productivity metrics (absenteeism, revenue/employee), and satisfaction, to identify trends, improve management, and align HR strategies with business outcomes, moving beyond intuition to make informed, strategic decisions about talent and workforce effectiveness.**

# Domain
  **HR ANALYTICS**
  # Objective

1. To identify meaningful patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA)

2. To clean, transform, and preprocess the data for analysis

3. To create meaningful visualizations that clearly explain the story behind the data

4. To provide actionable insights and recommendations from the analysis

# Data Pre-processing
*  **The analysis journey began with data preprocessing, where I meticulously cleaned the 'Uncleaned_employees_final_dataset'. Duplicate rows were eliminated, and irrelevant data types in numeric columns were filtered out using Python.**
# Note For Kind of Analysis to be done
**Type of Analysis**

 **Descriptive Analysis (summarizing the dataset)**

    Descriptive analytics can provide HR teams with valuable
    insights into employee performance, engagement, and retention.
      
    For example, by analyzing data from employee surveys, HR teams
    can identify trends and patterns in employee satisfaction andengagement. 
       
    This information can then be used to make improvements to the workplace and address any issues that may be negatively 
    impacting employee morale.

**Diagnostic Analysis (finding reasons behind patterns)**
    
    If an organization's employee turnover rate has increased, diagnostic analytics can help HR teams identify the reasons behind this trend.
    
    By analyzing data from exit interviews, performance evaluations, and other sources, HR teams can gain insights into why employees are leaving and what can be done to improve retention.

**Predictive Analysis (optional if forecasting required using basic steps)**

    Predictive analytics can be incredibly valuable for HR teams, as it allows them to anticipate potential issues and take proactive measures to address them. 

    By analyzing data from employee surveys and performance evaluations, HR teams can identify employees who are at risk of leaving and take steps to improve their job satisfaction and engagement.

**Prescriptive Analysis (recommendations for business decisions)**

    Prescriptive analytics can help HR teams make more informed decisions about everything from hiring and onboarding to employee development and retention. 
    
    By analyzing data from a variety of sources, HR teams can gain insights into the most effective strategies for managing their workforce and achieving their goals.
